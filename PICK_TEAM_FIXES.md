# Pick Team Page - Bug Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Formation Change Not Updating Pitch Layout ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Changing formation dropdown did not rearrange the pitch slots to match the formation.

**Solution:**
- Added `formations` configuration object mapping each formation to defender/midfielder/forward counts
- Implemented `updatePitchLayout()` function that:
  - Saves existing players on the pitch
  - Regenerates slots based on selected formation
  - Restores players to new slots (up to formation limits)
  - Re-attaches event listeners to new slots
- Added change event listener to formation dropdown

**Example:** Changing from 4-4-2 to 3-5-2 now:
- Reduces defenders from 4 to 3 slots
- Increases midfielders from 4 to 5 slots
- Keeps forwards at 2 slots
- Players are automatically repositioned

### 2. Save Team Always Shows "Select 11 Players" Error ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Even when 11 players were selected, validation failed because `startingXI` array wasn't being populated correctly.

**Solution:**
- Enhanced validation message to show current count: `You currently have X players`
- Fixed `addPlayerToPitch()` to ensure players are added to `startingXI` array
- Fixed `removePlayerFromPitch()` to properly remove from `startingXI` array
- Added `trackChanges` parameter to control when to update UI during batch operations

**Validation now shows:**
- "Please select 11 players for your starting XI. You currently have 5 players."
- This helps users understand exactly how many more players they need

### 3. Save Button Should Only Be Active When Changes Made ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Save button was always enabled, even when no changes were made.

**Solution:**
- Save button starts **disabled** with gray styling
- Added `initialState` variable that captures team state on page load
- Implemented `updateSaveButton()` function that:
  - Compares current state with initial state
  - Checks if exactly 11 players are selected
  - Enables button (purple) only when both conditions are met
  - Disables button (gray) when no changes or incomplete team

**Button States:**
- **Disabled (Gray):** No changes made OR less than 11 players
- **Enabled (Purple):** Changes made AND exactly 11 players selected

**Triggers that update button state:**
- Adding/removing players from pitch
- Selecting captain/vice-captain
- Changing formation
- Selecting/deselecting chips

**After successful save:**
- Initial state is updated to new saved state
- Button returns to disabled (gray) until next change

## Technical Implementation

### New Functions Added:
1. `updateSaveButton()` - Enables/disables save button based on changes
2. `updatePitchLayout(formation)` - Rearranges pitch for selected formation
3. `createPositionSlots(position, count)` - Generates HTML for position slots
4. `restorePlayersToSlots(container, players, maxSlots)` - Restores players after layout change
5. `attachSlotListeners()` - Re-attaches drag/drop event listeners

### Modified Functions:
1. `addPlayerToPitch(slot, playerData, trackChanges = true)` - Added change tracking
2. `removePlayerFromPitch(slot, playerId, trackChanges = true)` - Added change tracking
3. `initializeTeamFromDatabase()` - Saves initial state, updates pitch layout
4. `selectCaptain(playerId)` - Calls updateSaveButton()
5. `selectViceCaptain(playerId)` - Calls updateSaveButton()
6. `selectChip(chipType)` - Calls updateSaveButton()
7. `saveTeamSelection()` - Updates initial state after successful save

### State Management:
```javascript
let initialState = null;  // JSON string of initial team state
let hasChanges = false;    // Boolean flag for UI feedback
let startingXI = [];       // Array of 11 player IDs
let formations = {         // Formation configurations
    '4-4-2': { def: 4, mid: 4, fwd: 2 },
    '3-5-2': { def: 3, mid: 5, fwd: 2 },
    // ... etc
};
```
