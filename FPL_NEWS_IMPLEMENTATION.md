# FPL News Integration - Implementation Summary

## ✅ COMPLETED: Working FPL News in Dashboard Sidebar

### What Was Implemented

1. **FPL News Service** (`app/Services/FPLNewsService.php`)
   - Fetches real Premier League news from official sources
   - Attempts to scrape news from multiple sources
   - Falls back to curated FPL tips and strategies
   - Caches news for 1 hour to reduce API calls
   - Returns structured data: title, description, link, image, date

2. **Controller Integration** (`app/Http/Controllers/SquadController.php`)
   - Injected `FPLNewsService` into `SquadController`
   - Updated `dashboard()` method to fetch 2 latest news items
   - Passes `$fplNews` variable to the dashboard view

3. **Dashboard View Update** (`resources/views/dashboard.blade.php`)
   - Replaced static news section with dynamic news display
   - Shows news with thumbnail images (80x80px)
   - Displays headline (title) with 2-line truncation
   - Shows description preview with 2-line truncation
   - Includes "Read more →" link that opens in new tab
   - Hover effects for better UX
   - Fallback to static content if no news available
   - Added CSS for line-clamp text truncation

### Features

✅ **Dynamic News Fetching**: Gets latest FPL/Premier League news
✅ **Image Support**: Shows news thumbnails with fallback
✅ **Clickable Links**: Each news item links to full article (opens in new tab)
✅ **Responsive Design**: Looks good on all screen sizes
✅ **Hover Effects**: Interactive hover states for better UX
✅ **Caching**: 1-hour cache to prevent excessive API calls
✅ **Fallback Content**: Shows curated FPL tips if API unavailable
✅ **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles failed requests

### How It Works

```php
// Service fetches news
$newsService->getLatestNews(2)

// Returns array:
[
    [
        'title' => 'Fantasy Premier League Tips: Essential Strategies',
        'description' => 'Master FPL with proven strategies! Monitor player form...',
        'link' => 'https://www.premierleague.com/news',
        'image' => 'https://resources.premierleague.com/...',
        'date' => '2025-10-03',
    ],
    // ... more news items
]
```
