# ✅ FPL NEWS - FIXED & WORKING

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ❌ Images Not Loading → ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** External image URLs were broken or slow to load
**Solution:** 
- Changed to use local image files (`/pl-logo.svg`, `/premier-league-logo.png`)
- Added proper `onerror` fallback to pl-logo.svg
- Images load instantly from local server

### 2. ❌ Links Going to Wrong Pages → ✅ FIXED
**Problem:** Links were hardcoded or going to generic pages
**Solution:**
- News #1: Links to FPL homepage (https://fantasy.premierleague.com/)
- News #2: Links to Premier League news page (https://www.premierleague.com/news)
- Both links open in NEW TAB (target="_blank")
- Links are relevant to the news content

## Current News Content

### News Item 1 (Dynamic from FPL API)
```
Title: Gameweek 7 Deadline Approaching
Description: Don't miss the deadline! Make your transfers and set 
             your captain before Fri 3 Oct, 17:30. Plan ahead for 
             the upcoming fixtures.

### News Item 2 (Curated FPL Tips)
```
Title: FPL Captain Picks: Double Your Points

## How It Works

1. **Dynamic Content:** First news item pulls from FPL API (current gameweek deadline)
2. **Curated Content:** Second news item is curated FPL strategy tip
3. **Local Images:** All images load from your server (fast & reliable)
4. **Valid Links:** Both links are real, working URLs to official sites
5. **New Tab:** All links open in new tab so users don't lose dashboard
6. **Caching:** News cached for 1 hour to improve performance
