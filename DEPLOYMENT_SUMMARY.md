## 🎯 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Ready for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy on Railway
1. Visit **https://railway.app**
2. Click **"Start a New Project"**
3. Choose **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Select **`Fantasy-Premier-League`**
5. Add **MySQL database** (click "New Service" → "Database" → "MySQL")

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard → Your service → Variables tab:

**Required:**
```env
APP_KEY=base64:xxx...  (generate with: php artisan key:generate --show)
APP_ENV=production
APP_DEBUG=false
APP_URL=https://your-app.up.railway.app  (update after first deploy)
```

**Optional (with good defaults):**
```env
LOG_LEVEL=error
SESSION_DRIVER=database
CACHE_STORE=database
```

### Step 4: Wait for Deploy
Railway will automatically:
- ✅ Install PHP 8.2 and dependencies
- ✅ Install Composer packages
- ✅ Build frontend assets (Vite)
- ✅ Run database migrations
- ✅ Start the application

### Step 5: Update APP_URL
After deployment, Railway provides a URL like:
`https://fantasy-premier-league-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`

Update the `APP_URL` variable with this URL.

### Deployment Phase:
1. Database migrations execute (`php artisan migrate --force`)
2. Configurations cached for performance
3. Application starts on Railway's assigned port
4. Health checks ensure application is running

### Database:
