6. **Verify:**
   - [ ] Dashboard shows updated team
   - [ ] Points may not update until next calculation

## Test Scenario 5: Edge Cases

### Test: User with Only Starting XI (No Bench)
1. Manually set user to have only `starting_xi`:
   ```sql
   UPDATE users SET selected_squad = NULL WHERE id = 4;
   ```
2. Login as that user
3. Navigate to `/pick-team`
4. **Verify:**
   - [ ] System auto-generates 4 bench players
   - [ ] Database updated with `selected_squad`
   - [ ] All 15 players now shown
   - [ ] No errors or crashes

### Test: Invalid Team Composition
1. Manually create invalid team (e.g., 2 GKs in starting XI)
2. Navigate to `/pick-team`
3. **Verify:**
   - [ ] System detects invalid composition
   - [ ] Auto-corrects to valid team
   - [ ] Warning shown in console
   - [ ] Page loads without crash

## Automated Test Command
```bash
# Update all users' points to ensure sync
php artisan fpl:update-user-points

# Verify output shows:
# - "Found X users with completed squads"
# - "‚úì Successfully updated X users"
# - No errors
```

## Database Verification Queries

### Check All Users' Squad Status
```sql
SELECT 
    id,
    name,
    JSON_LENGTH(starting_xi) as starting_count,
    JSON_LENGTH(selected_squad) as total_count,
    points,
    current_gameweek,
    gameweek_points
FROM users
WHERE squad_completed = 1;
```

**Expected Results:**
- `starting_count`: 11
- `total_count`: 15
- `points`: > 0
- `current_gameweek`: Latest GW number
- `gameweek_points`: > 0

### Check for Missing Bench Players
```sql
SELECT id, name, 'Missing selected_squad' as issue
FROM users
WHERE squad_completed = 1 
  AND selected_squad IS NULL

UNION

SELECT id, name, 'Incomplete squad' as issue  
FROM users
WHERE squad_completed = 1
  AND JSON_LENGTH(selected_squad) < 15;
```

**Expected:** 0 rows (no issues)

## Console Commands to Run

### 1. Clear All Caches
```bash
php artisan optimize:clear
```

### 2. Check Current State
```bash
# View user 3's data
php artisan tinker --execute="
\$u = DB::table('users')->where('id', 3)->first();
echo 'Starting XI: ' . (\$u->starting_xi ?? 'NULL') . PHP_EOL;
echo 'Selected Squad: ' . (\$u->selected_squad ?? 'NULL') . PHP_EOL;
echo 'Points: ' . \$u->points . PHP_EOL;
echo 'Current GW: ' . \$u->current_gameweek . PHP_EOL;
"
```

### 3. Update Points for All Users
```bash
php artisan fpl:update-user-points
```

### 4. Check Logs for Errors
```bash
# Windows
type storage\logs\laravel.log | Select-String -Pattern "ERROR" -Context 2

# Linux/Mac
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log | grep -i error
```

## Known Issues to Watch For

### ‚ùå If Bench Still Shows 0:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `teamData.bench` is Array(4), not Array(0)
3. Check database: `SELECT selected_squad FROM users WHERE id = X`
4. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
5. Clear Laravel cache: `php artisan optimize:clear`

### ‚ùå If Dashboard Doesn't Match Pick-Team:
1. Verify both use `getUserFullSquad()` method
2. Check database has same data in both fields
3. Look for exceptions in laravel.log
4. Test with different user account

### ‚ùå If Points Don't Update:
1. Check if `FPLPointsService` is calling `updateUserGameweekData()`
2. Run manual update: `php artisan fpl:update-user-points`
3. Check gameweeks table for finished gameweeks
4. Verify player_gameweek_stats has data

## Performance Checks

### Response Time Benchmarks
- Pick-team page: < 500ms
- Dashboard: < 300ms
- View full team: < 200ms
- Points page: < 1s (with calculations)
- Transfers page: < 500ms

### Database Query Count
- Pick-team: ~3-4 queries
- Dashboard: ~5-6 queries
- View full team: ~2-3 queries

Use Laravel Debugbar or Telescope to monitor.
