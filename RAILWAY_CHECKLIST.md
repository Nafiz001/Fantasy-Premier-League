## ðŸš¨ Common Issues & Solutions

### Build Fails
```bash
# Check that these are committed:

- package-lock.json
- All required files
```

### 500 Error
```bash
# Temporarily enable debug
APP_DEBUG=true

# Check logs in Railway dashboard
# Clear caches
railway run php artisan config:clear
railway run php artisan cache:clear
```

### Database Connection Error
```bash
# Verify MySQL service is running
# Check that Railway auto-injected DB variables
# Verify .env uses correct variable names:
DB_HOST=${MYSQLHOST}
DB_PORT=${MYSQLPORT}
DB_DATABASE=${MYSQLDATABASE}
DB_USERNAME=${MYSQLUSER}
DB_PASSWORD=${MYSQLPASSWORD}
```

### Assets Not Loading
- Ensure `npm run build` succeeded in logs
- Check `APP_URL` is correct
- Clear browser cache
- Check `public/build` was created

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

### Auto-Deployments
- Every push to main branch auto-deploys
- Railway shows build progress in real-time
- Can pause auto-deploy in settings if needed

### Database Backups
- Railway Pro includes automated backups
- Free tier: Use Railway CLI to export:
  ```bash
  railway connect
  mysqldump -u $MYSQLUSER -p$MYSQLPASSWORD $MYSQLDATABASE > backup.sql
  ```
